<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>
I have consistently gone to meetings, and only once did not attend, and in that case I had a pressing matter at the scheduled time and notified my team beforehand.
I have also made a concerted effort to finish my part early so others could build off of my stuff instead of having to wait until the last moment.
